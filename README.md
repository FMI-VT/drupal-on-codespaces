# Drupal on Codespaces

## Quickstart
* Open this project in Codespaces (google it if you still don't know how)
* When it starts run `sh setup.sh`
* When it finishes run `cd drupal_site` and then `drush serve`
* open the "ports" tab (right next to the terminal) and use the link under the "Local Address" to open your drupal instance
* admin login is
  * ACC: admin
  * PASS: 123

## Note:
* if you come back after some days - just start the codespaces again, go to the `drupal_site` folder, run `drush serve` again and in the `ports` tab follow the link to access your site
